# Credit Card Fraud Prediction
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. 
This is an important task for financial institutions as it helps them identify and prevent fraudulent activity, which can result in significant financial losses.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains over 6362620 credit card transactions, of which only 9000 are fraudulent.
The dataset includes features such as the transaction amount, balance of customer, and various anonymized features.

# Data Preprocessing
Before building the machine learning model, we need to preprocess the data to prepare it for training. This includes:

Scaling the features to ensure they have the same range and distribution
Handling missing values, if any
Addressing class imbalance by oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) 
Model Selection and Training
For this project, we will compare the performance of several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBoost.
We will train each model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results
Based on our evaluation metrics, we will select the best performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to further improve its performance.
We will also visualize the results using various plots and charts to gain insights into the model's predictions.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict credit card fraud transactions. 
By identifying fraudulent activity early, financial institutions can take appropriate actions to prevent financial losses and protect their customers.
